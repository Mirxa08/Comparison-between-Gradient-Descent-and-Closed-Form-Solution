# Comparison between Gradient Descent and Closed-Form Solution

In this task, we work with a training dataset consisting of two files: DataX and DataY. DataX contains three attributes - living area, number of bedrooms, and number of floors, while DataY represents the corresponding house prices for these attributes. With a total of 50 training examples (m=50), we explore various operations and analyses on this dataset to gain insights and perform predictive modeling tasks.

## Gradient Descent Plot
The first 3D plot generated by gradient descent represents the predicted values (Y) as a function of normalized floors and normalized bedrooms. The plot shows a surface that represents the linear model's predictions. The surface is generated by iteratively updating the parameters (theta0, theta1, theta2, and theta3) using gradient descent. The color map used is 'viridis.'

## Closed-Form Solution Plot
The second 3D plot generated by the closed-form solution also represents the predicted values (Y) as a function of normalized floors and normalized bedrooms. However, this surface is calculated directly using the closed-form solution without iterations. The color map used is 'plasma.'

## Comparison

When comparing the gradient descent and closed-form solution (CFS) approaches in predictive modeling, several observations arise from the generated plots.

The gradient descent plot depicts a surface where the X-axis represents the number of bedrooms, the Y-axis represents the number of floors, and the Z-axis represents the predicted house prices. In this plot, the surface appears to cover a greater length along the X-Z plane, indicating a more extensive range of predictions concerning the number of bedrooms and prices. This lengthier coverage along the X-Z plane suggests that the gradient descent approach may capture more variation in house prices concerning the number of bedrooms while somewhat neglecting the influence of the number of floors.

Conversely, the closed-form solution plot exhibits a surface where the X-axis represents the number of bedrooms, the Y-axis represents the number of floors, and the Z-axis represents the predicted house prices. Here, the surface extends more widely along the X-Y plane, indicating a broader range of predictions concerning both the number of bedrooms and the number of floors. This wider coverage along the X-Y plane implies that the closed-form solution may consider a broader spectrum of interactions between the number of bedrooms and floors in predicting house prices, potentially capturing more nuanced relationships between these variables.

Different color maps ('viridis' for gradient descent and 'plasma' for the closed-form solution) are used to represent the surfaces. These color maps can affect the visual perception of the plots as shown in the Figure above.


In summary, while the gradient descent approach emphasizes the relationship between the number of bedrooms and house prices, the closed-form solution appears to offer a more comprehensive perspective by considering the joint influence of both the number of bedrooms and floors on house prices.
